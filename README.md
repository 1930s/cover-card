## Gem-based theme for use with jekyll remote theme

[A working example](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card) demonstrates that the new [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages) functionally efficiently separates content from presentation and enables you to [keep in your repository only the custom assets](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card/tree/gh-pages), e.g., images, configuration.

In this way, you will receive future updates without pulling and resolving conflicts from the upstream. In the case that you don't link a particular update (e.g. font change or font size), you can always [revert your remote_theme to the last known good configuration by pointing to a particular commit](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme). Moreover, it becomes easier to switch to other similar themes.
