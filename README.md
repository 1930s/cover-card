## Gem-based theme for use with jekyll remote theme

[A working example](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card) demonstrates that the new [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages) functionally efficiently separates content from presentation and enables you to keep in your repository only the custom assets, e.g., images, configuration.

In this way, you will receive future updates without pulling and resolving conflicts from the upstream. Moreover, it becomes easier to switch to other similar themes.

## Why choose this jekyll theme for your front page?
* You don't have to modify any HTML, everything can be modified in config.yml.
* Very lightweight. No Javascript, No Bootstrap etc..
* MIT licensed.
