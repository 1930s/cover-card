# Cover Card jekyll theme

Create a cover page for your social media profiles, host it for free on Github Pages, and maintain it in minutes, not hours. [Demo](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card)

## Make it yours

[Fork this repository](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card/fork) and edit the files in the **gh-pages** branch to your liking: As a first step, you may want to replace the images and edit the `_config.yml` with your online profiles. You can test the result almost in real-time at the Github Pages url displayed in the Settings tab.

The avatar image should be square and at least 200 pixels. There is no aspect ratio requirement for the background image, but it should be big enough for contemporary (desktop, tablet, phone) computer displays and dark enough in order to work for the white foreground text and icons. Chances are that you have a selfie somewhere in your media storage. If you don't have a background image then you can use a public domain one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

You can find advanced options (CNAME, custom social icons, styles) for this theme in the documentation (readme) at the [master branch](https://github.com/epidrome/cover-card/tree/master).
