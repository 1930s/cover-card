# Cover-card jekyll theme

[A working example](https://epidrome.github.io/cover-card) demonstrates that the new [jekyll remote theme](https://github.com/blog/2464-use-any-theme-with-github-pages) functionally efficiently separates content from presentation, so you can keep in your repository only the custom assets, e.g., images, configuration.

In this way, you will receive future updates without pulling and resolving conflicts from the main theme. In the case that you don't like a particular update (e.g. font change, or font size), you can always [revert your remote_theme to the last known good configuration by pointing to a particular commit](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme). Moreover, it becomes easier to switch to other similar themes.

## Make it yours

Fork this repository and edit the files in the **gh-pages** branch to your liking: As a first step, you may want to replace the images in the /assets/images folder and edit the `_config.yml` with your online profiles. You can test the result almost in real-time at `yourusername.github.io/cover-card/`

The avatar image should be square and at least 200 pixels. There is no aspect ratio requirement for the background image, but it should be big enough for contemporary computer displays and dark enough in order to work for the white foreground text and icons.
